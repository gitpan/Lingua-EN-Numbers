Revision history for perl module Lingua::EN::Numbers

1.02 2011-11-20

    - Neil Bowers <neilb@cpan.org> has taken over maintenance
    - fixed a bug affecting numbers over 1 million, where the right-hand
      three digits are 0\d\d (i.e. 99 or less), you'd get a rogue comma.
      e.g. 1001001 became "one million, one thousand and, one"
    - renamed ChangeLog to Changes, and reformatted to CPAN::Changes::Spec


1.01 2005-01-05

	- total rewrite
	- It's more gooder now, in interface, internals, and accuracy.
	- More tests.
	- Mostly backwards compatable.  (But if you relied on the olde
	  stylee "British" mode, with "billiards" et al, you're out of
	  luck.)
